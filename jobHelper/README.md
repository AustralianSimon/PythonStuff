# PythonStuff\jobHelper

This is a script I was working on to help people be better applicants for jobs as well as a find more jobs.

You put your cover letter and resume docx files in the \checkfiles\ subdirectory prior to running.

Additionally, using the keywords csv you add in key phrases from the job you are applying for to have the script analyse your letter and resume based on the keywords to give you a rating.

The analysis outputs a report.html file with results.
